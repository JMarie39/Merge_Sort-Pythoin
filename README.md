### Author/s:

- AGULTO, Juliana Marie

A student-project implementing the recursive merge sort algorithm using Python. The program should output the sorting process

### Contents:

- [merge_sort](merge_sort.py) - Merge sort program

### Instructions:

- Open the terminal.
- Run the [merge_sort.py](merge_sort.py) file.
- Input the number of elements that they want to sort and the list elements that they want to sort. Assume that all inputs are integers.
- The program will display the contents of the list after every merge operation.
- Lastly, display the sorted list.
